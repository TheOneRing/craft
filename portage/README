This directory contains the main portage tree.
Third Party in this Context means "Not KDE"

It is divided into several subcategories:
data : Raw data from third party sources (Dictonaries, Maps, etc.)
dev-util: Neccessary and optional tools for developers and to build on Windows
extragear: Portage files for KDE extragear Software
gnuwin32: Tools from the gnuwin32 initiative (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/)
internal: Internal dependencies of the Emerge Build System
kde: The core parts of the KDE Software Compilation
kdeapps: Additional KDE applications
kdesupport: Libraries from the greater KDE Community but not really core KDE
libs: Qt is so fat it even got it's own category ;)
binary: Binary packages that we do not build with emerge
templates: Templates for new portage files
testing: Instable / under development portage that is not generic or untested
virtual: Metapackages used to define a group of dependencies
win32libs-bin: Binary versions of win32libs-sources
win32libs-sources: The main category for third party libraries we can compile
